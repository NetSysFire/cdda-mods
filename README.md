Random stuff I worked on.

## End of Days

Status: Very incomplete. Unplayable.

The end times have come. The Cataclysm ravaged the world decades ago. Initially, giant insects and evolving, zombified humans scoured the earth but the ecosystem collapsed.
The rivers ran dry, the water was poisoned and the very soil under your feet has become infertile and corrupted.

## Medieval

Status: Literally just a skeleton mod with no content.

## Immutable Wall

Status: Working.

Transforms the rock border in the bordered scenario into something that can not be passed with any means.
Thus enforces living inside the bordered area.
